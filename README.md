# SC Tuning Core Public - Forza Motorsport 7 Telemetry Tooling

Welcome to **SC Tuning Core Public** ‚Äî a repository of open-source tools, documentation, and ideas for interacting with Forza Motorsport 7 telemetry. 

This repo shares components, concepts, and cleaned-up experiments that support our work in **telemetry-based vehicle tuning**, **data analysis**, and **automation frameworks** used in Forza Motorsport 7 and beyond.

> This is not the main SC Tuning engine. That system is private and powers our core service.
> Instead, this space is for sharing what can help the community, honor GPLv3 contributions, and give back.

## üè† About SC Tuning

**SC Tuning** is a project focused on advanced telemetry-driven vehicle tuning.
We use structured data pipelines, modular metric extractors, and machine-assisted optimization to fine-tune cars for maximum grip, agility, and competitive responsiveness.

Our work spans:
- Telemetry capture and preprocessing
- Time-to-speed, G-force, acceleration metrics
- Modular analysis tools (Go, Python)
- Auto-comparison and tuning suggestion workflows

## üîó What's in This Repo

- `examples/` ‚Äî Sample tuning pipelines, test data, and sandbox code
- `metrics/` ‚Äî Open-source versions of performance metric extractors
- `docs/` ‚Äî Architectural concepts, public tuning insights, and system diagrams
- `LICENSE` ‚Äî MIT License for original work; GPLv3 for any incorporated public code

We will continue to expand this repo over time with sanitized, public-safe versions of tools and ideas we think will benefit the broader tuning and data science community.
