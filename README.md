# SC Tuning Core Public - Forza Motorsport 7 Telemetry Tooling

Welcome to **SC Tuning Core Public** ‚Äî the open lab of SC Tuning.

This repository contains open-source tools, telemetry scripts, and architectural insights from the SC Tuning Core system. It is a **developer-focused space** to share, study, and collaborate on data-driven vehicle tuning strategies, especially for Forza Motorsport 7 and related projects.

> ‚ö° This is **not the final product or service interface.** If you're looking for tuning calculators, curated packs, or community-facing experiences, visit [SC Tuning Pro](https://github.com/sc-tuning-pro).

## üè† Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Share sanitized components of our internal SC Tuning Core system
- Release metric extractors and analysis tools for public learning and collaboration
- Document our tuning architecture, principles, and data formats

We use Go, Python, and structured telemetry data to derive high-performance builds and tuning heuristics.

## üîó What's Inside

- `examples/` ‚Äî Sample pipelines, telemetry transformations, and working test cases
- `metrics/` ‚Äî Modular extractors for G-force, speed ramps, acceleration windows, etc.
- `docs/` ‚Äî Diagrams, workflow maps, and philosophical notes on tuning systems

All content here is intended to help others learn, adapt, and build their own analysis stack.

## üîç When to Use This Repo

Use **sc-tuning-core-public** if you want to:
- Study telemetry transformation logic
- Contribute new analysis tooling or metric models
- Understand how our internal Core system works (without accessing private internals)
